# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python application for converting various document formats to Markdown format. The project is in early development stage.

## Development Setup

This project appears to be Python-based. Look for standard Python project files like:
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies
- `setup.py` for package configuration
- Source code likely in a `src/` or project root directory

## Commands

Since this is an early-stage project, standard Python development commands would likely include:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (when requirements.txt exists)
- `python -m pytest` (for running tests when they exist)
- `python -m mypy .` (for type checking if mypy is used)

## Architecture

The project structure is not yet established. This section should be updated as the codebase develops with information about:
- Main conversion logic organization
- Supported input/output formats
- Core modules and their responsibilities
